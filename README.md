# Paris 2024 Men's 100m Final Visualization

This project visualizes a men's 100m final race using matplotlib. The animation shows the race progress over time with markers at 20m intervals indicating where each athlete was when the first athlete reached that point.

## Features

- **Real-time Race Animation**: Watch as each athlete progresses through the race.
- **Distance Markers**: Horizontal lines are drawn at 20m, 40m, 60m, and 80m marks to show the relative positions of all athletes when the first athlete reaches those distances.
- **Lanes Visualization**: The lanes are clearly marked, and the athletes' movements are animated in real-time.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy
   ```
3. Run the Python script to generate the GIF:

   ```
4. The GIF will be saved as `100m_mens_final_interpolated.gif`.
Note: It needs atleast 5GB of Free RAM to run.
